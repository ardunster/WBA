# World Builder Alpha (WBA)

WBA is an in-progress application designed to help authors with tasks of world building and organization. It's a 'learning app' for me, intended to broaden my grasp of Python, PosstgreSQL and any other technologies that become relevant.

If you'd like to view updates, such as posts on my decision making process for various technologies, they're available [on my blog under the WBA tag](https://annardunster.com/tag/wba/). 

Keep in mind, I am practicing using branching to develop features. If you don't see any recent updates in `primary`, check for an alternate branch that I may be working in!

## Overview

WBA is a tool for keeping all your world building information together and organized, and easily seeing what different pieces of your world link together and how. It groups data by Character, Event, Location, Faction (or Species), and Power (or Magic), and provides for linking each of these to each other.

WBA is built on a PostgreSQL database and written in Python. 

## Planned Features

I'll update this with a more complete overview as time allows.

- Custom fields in character pages (maybe others?)
- Can use an internet hosted instance of PostgreSQL, so you can have your data anywhere
- Events timeline - interactive, scaleable timeline for searching through events

## Requested Features

I got a request for an option to export to a wiki format. I'll have to research to see how possible that is, but if it's not difficult to standardize, I'd love to make that possible. 


If you have any suggestions or feedback or are interested in trying the program as soon as I have a workable build, please send me an email or comment on my blog, I'd be happy to hear from you!

Thanks,
Anna
