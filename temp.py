Order of construction:

pick data handling framework/database
get character, location basics working - default classes - parent class for new custom classes
get event basics working

ui basics 
linking (every "add link" function should be bidirectional !! )
timeline
categories (character, location, event)

no particular order yet:

text editor (with autosave?)
whiteboard/oekaki
image inclusion
character rando question
ui for splash, pick world, new world, etc
analyze
maps
custom datetime
ui for settings/world config. 
    - are there any universal settings or all per world?
automatic db backups, options like - keep the x most recent backups, plus x per month/week, etc

error handling
search functionality
custom category ?

cloud save

verify links - every link has a backlink - do I need this? maybe, if my DB seems error prone
restore view when reopening program
write webpages, load webpages? might facilitate wiki export.
