main program:
try:
    load config
except (file not found):
    run new config setup

new config setup: confirms that you don't have a config and defaults to set up
new. Option to import config file. (Security? - maybe actually secure
credentials - ie username, password for psql are not stored in config, but in a separate unrecoverable file -
then how does the program recover them when restart?)

config setup screen (same screen can be accessed in-program):
    table
    interface   is main     is backup
    json        radio       multi check
    psql        radio       multi check
    solid pod   radio       multi check
    etc 

    any checked option will have further setup options
    warn if switching main from one to another if there is data: sync first,
    does not delete old data, may take time if not previously set up

    backup: how often do we sync?
