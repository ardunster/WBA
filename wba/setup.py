'''
need to get input  from user for pgadmin /PostgreSQL and pass to dbinterface.py
to write config

so far, end user must manually set up PostgreSQL:
    - install or get hosted PostgreSQL
    - set up a login specifically for wba, preferably
    - create a database for wba
hopefully I will find a way to script/automate as much of that as possible
(maybe an option of 'do you want setup to install PostgreSQL or will you have
 it hosted elsewhere', then either setup or get login details)
